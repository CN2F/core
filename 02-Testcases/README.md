# Test cases

We have deployed two different test cases:

1. In the first test case, we focus on measuring the effects of VNF placement. Here we deploy two scenarios in which we simulate the `Cloud Computing` and `Mobile Edge Computing`. Other that Kubernetes and docker, we utilize some other tools like `onos` and `mininet`. The documentation of this test case can be found [here](./VNF/).

2. In the second one, we focus on measuring the effects of slicing `RB`s in differen UEs. Here we deploy one scenario with two slices, a big and an small slice. Then we assiciate one UE to the first slice and one UE to the other slice. The documentation of this test case can be found [here](./Slicing/).
