# Software Materials

Here we have some software materials like Dockerfiles, docker images, and Pod deployment files. You can follow the steps in each folder in order to obtain required docs for the next step.

## Docker Images
There are two ways to obtain docker images, pulling them or building them, both of them are explained in [this](./Docker/) section. We suggest that for a quick start, just pull images; For a better look and customizing some properties, try building images.

## Kubernetes Stuff
In order to bring up Kubernetes files, we need to have some `pod` definition files. These files can be found [here](./Kubernetes/). Not that you need to have the cluster deployed on nodes to bring up CN2F network.
