# Infrastructure

Here we discuss the underlying infrastrucrue of CN2F, and how to deploy the reuired modules to get ready and run testbeds.

There are 3 steps towards deploying requied infrastructure:

1. Installing OS: You have to install `ubuntu 18.04 LTS` on all systems.
2. Install software packages: After installing OS on systems, you have to install some software packages like `docker`, `i7z`, and `git`. This proccess is automated with the help of [ansible](./Ansible/).
